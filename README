This repo is for Alex Glass (aglass) and Carlos Armendariz (carmenda) 15-418 Final Project

There are two implementations we created each with the same 7 benchmarks.

To run either implementation, do the following:

1. Within sceneLoader.cpp of the implementation you desire to run, there is a
  list of benchmarks and their code. Ensure that numParticles is set to your
  desired value for the benchmark you choose. Change nothing else

2. cd into the folder of the implementation you want and run 'make'
  (dont run 'make veryclean' it may delete all the code)

3. now run './render BENCHMARK_NAME MAX_PARTICLES'
  MAX_PARTICLES should be equal to or greater than the number used in step 1.
  Possible benchmark names are: 'stream1', 'stream2', 'stream4', 'circle',
                                'blackhole', 'dyn1', and 'dyn2'
  dyn1 and dyn2 are dynamic benchmarks that spawn particles

4. to exit, simply exit out of the display window.


Direct any questions troubles to aglass@andrew.cmu.edu

Thanks.
